# WTF is `fn199`

Finding longest matching substring using the 3-byte hash stored in `var201` and a hash table stored in `dat_arr163`.



```
For `x` < 1024:
  dat_arr163[idx] -> idx -- The index of the prior hash match for this index
For 1024 <= `x` < (1024 + 4096)
  dat_arr163[hash] -> idx -- The index of the last match for this hash
```

For example, given the input `abcdabcd`, after the first 4 bytes have been read. The hash of the next 3 bytes(`abc`) is `1859`. The other hash values of interest are:

```
"abc" -> 1859
"bcd" -> 1108
"cda" -> 1313
"dab" -> 626
```

NOTE: Hash values are truncated to 12 bits by `& 4095`.

This hash is then offset by the uncompressed data size(`1<<(10 + level)`). For this example we'll assume a level of `0`, which gives an uncompressed size of `1024`.

So we end up with the hash value of `2883`. This is then used to look up in `dat_arr163` to find if we've seen a sequence with the same hash, and hopefully the same sequence of bits.

Let's look at the state of `dat_arr163` at this point:
```
# Setup 'data' section.
dat_arr163[0..1024] = 0
# Setup 'hash' section.
dat_arr163[1024..(1024+4096)] = 0

# Previous iterations have set these values
dat_arr163[0] = -1
dat_arr163[1] = -1
dat_arr163[2] = -1
dat_arr163[3] = -1
dat_arr163[1024+626] = 3  # Index of "dab"
dat_arr163[1024+1108] = 1 # Index of "bcd"
dat_arr163[1024+1313] = 2 # Index of "bcd"
dat_arr163[1024+1859] = 0 # Index of "bcd"
```

From here we can see the beginings of a hash table, where you first access the index of the hash and then access each subsequent entry with the same hash by accessing the index returned from the previous hash lookup, until getting `-1`;

# Using the hash table to find the longest hash

So to find the longest hash we need to:
1. Visit each of the places pointed at in the hash table
2. Figure out if there is a run, and if so what is it's length
3. Return the longest run.

Because the hash table's key could point to a large number of runs, we limit the depth we search to limit the cost of the actual search.

```
fn (hash, current_index) {
  test_index = hash
  for (several attempts) {
    // Grab the index we want to test based on the index stored in the hash table.
    test_index = dat_arr163[test_index]
    if (test_index < 0) { // I.E. -1
      break; // No data
    }
    // Otherwise use the index to start searching for the hash
    for i in 0..MAX_LENGTH { // MAX_LENGTH == 256
      if (data[test_index + i] != data[current_index + 1]) {
        // We've stopped matching
        run_length = i
        break;
      }
    }

    if (run_length > 3) {
      // Found a suitable run. Runs < 3 aren't worth compressing.
      if (?????)
      if (?bounds check?)
      if (run_length >= MAX_LENGTH) break
    }
  }
}
```
